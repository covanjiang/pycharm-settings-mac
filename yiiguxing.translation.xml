      <item value="When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will block until the thread terminates.

It is also an error to join() a thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same exception." />
      <item value="hen the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call isAlive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the thread is still alive, the join() call timed out." />

If a handler wants to override this behavior (e.g., to simulate a misconfigured or overloaded web server during testing), it can raise a ResponseException.

Defaults to 100. extra_lines (int, optional): Extra lines of code. Defaults to 3. theme (Optional[str], optional): Pygments theme to use in traceback. Defaults to ``None`` which will pick a theme appropriate for the platform. word_wrap (bool, optional): Enable word wrapping of long lines. Defaults to False. show_locals (bool, optional): Enable display of local variables. Defaults to False. locals_max_length (int, optional): Maximum length of containers before abbreviating, or None for no abbreviation. Defaults to 10. locals_max_string (int, optional): Maximum length of string before truncating, or None to disable. Defaults to 80. locals_hide_dunder (bool, optional): Hide locals prefixed with double underscore. Defaults to True. locals_hide_sunder (bool, optional): Hide locals prefixed with single underscore.
