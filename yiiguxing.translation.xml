      <item value="When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will block until the thread terminates. A thread can be join()ed many times. join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same exception." />
      <item value="hen the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call isAlive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the thread is still alive, the join() call timed out." />

      <item value="Normally, THttpServer always sends a 200 response. If a handler wants to override this behavior (e.g., to simulate a misconfigured or overloaded web server during testing), it can raise a ResponseException. The function passed to the constructor will be called with the RequestHandler as its only argument. Note that this is irrelevant for ONEWAY requests, as the HTTP response must be sent before the RPC is processed." />
